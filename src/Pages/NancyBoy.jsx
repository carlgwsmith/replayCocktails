is simple, raw, and packs a flavor that&#39;ll make your ears ring. It&#39;s the perfect pre-show fuel, or for
when you just wanna stick it to the man by gettin&#39; a little messy.</p>
        <p>Ditch the foo-foo drinks and crack open a Nancy Boy. No frills, no fuss â€“ just pure, unfiltered
punk rock energy in a can. Nancy Boy: Taste the rebellion.</p>
