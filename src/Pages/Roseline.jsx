        <p className="mb-10">Saddle up and quench your thirst with Roseline, the mighty fine grapefruit paloma in a can! This
little firecracker packs a punch of smooth vodka, a hint of reposado, tangy grapefruit, and a
squeeze of lime, just like a rodeo bull with a heart of gold. It&#39;s all perfectly balanced for a taste
that&#39;ll have you moseyin&#39; on back for another sip.</p>
<p className="mb-10">Forget messin&#39; around with fancy shakers and mixers. Roseline is ready to ride whenever you
are, no matter if you&#39;re relaxin&#39; by the campfire or fixin&#39; fence posts. Just pop the top, pour over
ice, and let the good times roll.</p>
