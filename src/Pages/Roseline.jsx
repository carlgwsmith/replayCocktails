        <h4 className="font-bold mb-4">Howdy, partner! Thirsty after a long day wranglin' under the scorchin' sun? </h4>
        <p className="mb-10">Saddle up and quench your thirst with Roseline, the mighty fine grapefruit paloma in a can! This little firecracker packs a punch of smooth vodka, tangy grapefruit, and a squeeze of lime, just like a rodeo bull with a heart of gold. It's all perfectly balanced for a taste that'll have you saying "yeehaw!" and moseyin' on back for another sip.</p>
<p className="mb-10">
Forget messin' around with fancy shakers and mixers. Roseline is ready to ride whenever you are, no matter if you're relaxin' by the campfire or fixin' fence posts. Just pop the top, pour over ice, and let the good times roll.</p>
