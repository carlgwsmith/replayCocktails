Introducing Beltane, the canned cocktail that's as cool as a cucumber and smooth as a summer breeze. This bad boy blends cucumber-infused vodka with fresh gin, a squeeze of lime, and a hint of mint, creating a flavor that's crisp, clean, and oh-so-refreshing.</p>
<p>
Forget the fuss of muddling and mixing, Beltane is pre-game ready. Just pop the top, pour over ice, and let the good vibes flow. Perfect for picnics in the park, rooftop hangs, or poolside
lounging. ☀️</p>
